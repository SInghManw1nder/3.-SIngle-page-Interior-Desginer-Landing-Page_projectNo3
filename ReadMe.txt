This is my 3rd web development project. 
I have used basic HTML and CSS to create this simple landing page. 
I learned basic and fundamental concepts of HTML and CSS like text shadow, hover effects, positioning etc. from this project.

This is just my third project so it took me more time to work out the basics in a proper hands-on.
